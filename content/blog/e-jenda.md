My newest project is going to be an E-Jenda: a digital agenda. It lets you put items in that you have to do. As you complete them, you can check them off. If there are any items that you haven't completed by the end of the day, it starts sending notifications.

I haven't started building it _yet_, but check back soon for a sneak peek!
